Tied in to slack for simplicity

## upcoming:

- speak to ai agent for quick interactions (eg natural language conversation with reprompting prior to action execution)
- speak within slack thread to maintain context

- web dash to interact with personal trello tasks
- manual addition of tasks to trello from web ui
- mobile app shipped with capacitor
