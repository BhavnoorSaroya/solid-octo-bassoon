# AI agent for task managment

This was made as a proof of concept in 3 hours, the idea is to have an ai agent that can manage trello tasks which you can converse with in naturual language

Tied in to slack for simplicity


## upcoming:

**I'll get to this at some point**
- web dash to interact with personal trello tasks
- speak to ai agent for quick interactions (eg custom queries)
- manual addition of tasks to trello from web ui
- mobile app shipped with capacitor
